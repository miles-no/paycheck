' The payment calculation matrix maps the different project tasks to the different payment rules... This can be hardcoded untill we figure out how it works.

' Each employe has the following variables that affect the payment calculation:
' - Yearly salary ( Normally 600 000 )
' - Own cost factor ( normally 1.5 )
' - Provision percentage ( varies the most ) 

' So basicly just the provision percentage is needed to calculate the payment for each employee.

' The rest of the variables are hardcoded in the calculation matrix. And we get the timesheets with the hourly-rates from Xledger.
